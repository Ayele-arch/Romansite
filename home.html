<h1>charity to our community </h1>

<p>The greatest gift to our community would be when we contribute to making lives better; when we touch lives by the dint of donations or charity, spreading light to the most needy and enlighten our souls in the process.</p>


<h1> Our Works</h1>
<p> the act of giving money,goods,time to the unfortunate,either directly or 
by means of a trust or other worthy cause.</p>

<h2> Your greatness is not what you have it is what you give</h2>

<p>the voluntaries giving of help to those need it as 
humanitarian act that acts of  extending love and kindness 
to others unconditionally, which is a conscious  act but the 
decision is made by the heart, without expecting a reward. when charity is 
carried out selflessly</p>
